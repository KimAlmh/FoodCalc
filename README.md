# FoodCalc

This is a work in progress. It will use many different languages and tools.  
The point of this repo is first and foremost to learn and improve.

Project that you add what you have eaten in a day and it will calculate the nutritional info. 
You add the food to the database if it does not exist. Then you add the food and weight and it will save that in a database.
You can then see all the food and nutritional info you have eaten over a period of time.

The finished project will have:  
API and database for food data. (Made with C# ASP.NET Core and SQL Server)  
API and database for user data. (Made with Java and PostgreSQL)  
Authentication/authorzation with JWT. (Made with Java and PostgreSQL)  
Frontend website for accessing and using the application. (Made with mix of Razor or MVC and normal html/css/js)
